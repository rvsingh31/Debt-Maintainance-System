# Debt-Maintainance-System

Hey Visitor!

This is my first college project on Web .
It is a web application of maintaining your expenses that can be day-to-day or a group.

By day-to-day ,I mean that every student living in a hostel has a fixed amount available to him that he can spend in the entire day and some of us have a habit of keeping a track about it . So this website helps you do it.

In group Event, if we go on a trip with our group,we tend to pay their expenses at a particular moment and collect them afterwards ,that's the normal procedure that is being carried out throughout the world.But what if you dont remember how much you owe someone or that other member owes you,at that moment,this site comes into picture ,similar to SPLITWISE and KNODUES android application ,it helps you settle and split bills amongst yourself.

One major drawback of this project is , as it was my first web project ,I wasn't aware about the mobile first ie responsive websites ,so this project isn't responsive which is the main reason behind not deploying it.

Anyone could look at the source code and make it responsive as you like .

Also import the sql file ,that i have uploaded in your local server to work with and in connection.php mention your dbname and dbpassword accordingly.

Thank you.
